try using this for probij instead:

change code for JC matrix
| 3/4 -1/4 -1/4 -1/4 |
|-1/4  3/4 -1/4 -1/4 |
|-1/4 -1/4  3/4 -1/4 |
|-1/4 -1/4 -1/4  3/4 |

Pij(v) = 1/4 + 3/4e^-(4/3*branchLen) if i=j
         1/4 - 1/4e^-(4/3*branchLen) else
  rate assumed to be 1/4 ^ 

instead of recursion, post order traversal

-become more familiar with stacks
    -reading in newick strings
    -good for interviews ( :^) )

for n leaf tree -> n-3 internal branch
    internal branches dictate the splits

test all tree combinations for maximum likelihood

n is a bigger cost than l(number of nucleobases)
this lab mostly does gene trees (l is between 300-1500) <- relatively small

excersize: 

n=5, l=30, how many floating point operations?

maybe try to make tree work for l>1?

figure out actually maximizing likelihood now that we have the function

likelihood is only a comparitive score

good question: is it possible to split tree into smaller tres-> maximize likelihood on subtree -> use subtree as leaf on larger tree
