calculate likelihood using GPU
    -execute ML using serial method, just speed up likelihood calc step?

determine size of tree to see performance increase

benchmark code
    -see % of time to run certain functions

if doing work on GPU -> have to seek help elsewhere 
other forms of paralellization possible besides GPU
    -performance increase still exists
    -shared memory across CPU
    
I NEED DATA!!! 
    -simulating data
        -erin has code
    -gathering data from internet
    
test how much changing one part of a tree affects the overall likelihood


test to make sure my likelihood kernel is working
    simulate data
    
add to code:
    -write likelihood profile before / after for each node with a change
    -change conditions for the updating of node likelihood profiles
